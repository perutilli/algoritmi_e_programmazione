This are the laboratories from my university Algorithms and programming course in C.

Each folder contains the text of the exercises in a PDF.

The files contained in the folder "libraries used" were provided by the professors and modified if required by the
exercise text.

Disregard the first line in all files ("#pragma warning (disable:4996)") as at the time I was using visual studio and the
line was necessary to get the code to compile.
